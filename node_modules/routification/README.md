# Routification [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/routification.png)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/routification)

Turn any connect app into an Express-like router.
In the future, Express will be a Routification instance.
Unlike Express 3.0, each route is its own middleware.
You will probably see a very insigificant performance drop,
but there's no more implicit `app.use(app.router)` you have to worry about.

Routification is built on [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/component/path-to-regexp).
If you have any issues with path matching,
please open an issue in that repository instead.

Routification assumes you've `npm install connect` yourself.
It does not rely on `connect` itself.

## API

### var app = routification([app], [options])

`app` is an optional `connect` instance.
`options` are passed to [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/component/path-to-regexp#pathtoregexppath-keys-options).

```js
var routify = require('routification')
var app = routify()
var app = routify(connect())
var app = routify({
  sensitive: true
})
var app = routify(connect(), {
  sensitive: true
})
```

### app[VERB](path || regexp, middleware...)

Verb can be any HTTP method supported by node.
`delete` is also aliased as `del`.
Each `middleware` should have a signature of `(req, res)` or `(req, res, next)`.

Note: if the request method is `HEAD`,
it will also match any `GET` routes as well.
To match `HEAD` and not `GET`,
do `app.head()` before any `app.get()`.

### app[all](path || regexp, middleware...)

Will match any request with the given path or regexp.
